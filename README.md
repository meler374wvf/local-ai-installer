The ultimate one-click installer and manager for running the most powerful open-source AI models on your personal computer. Forget complex setups, dependency hell, Python, and CUDA—AI Nexus Toolkit handles all the heavy lifting for you.
📝 Description

Running local AI models like Stable Diffusion or Llama can be a nightmare. It requires installing Python, Git, specific CUDA versions, dozens of libraries, and manually editing configuration files. One wrong step, and nothing works.

AI Nexus Toolkit is a desktop application for Windows and macOS that turns this complex process into a few simple clicks. Just pick a model from the built-in catalog, click "Install," and start creating, generating, and analyzing in minutes.
✨ Key Features

    One-Click Installation: Choose any model from our extensive library and install it hassle-free.
    Automatic Dependency Management: The toolkit automatically downloads and configures everything needed (Python, PyTorch, CUDA, FFMPEG, etc.).
    Unified GUI: Manage all your models from a single, user-friendly interface. No command line required.
    Extensive Model Library: We continuously update our catalog with the most popular and cutting-edge open-source models.
    Resource Management: Easily launch, stop, update, and delete models to free up disk space and GPU resources.

🚀 Getting Started
Requirements

    Windows: Windows 10/11 (x64) with an NVIDIA GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended).
    macOS: macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or newer. Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) is highly recommended for best performance.
    An active internet connection to download models (some can be tens of gigabytes).

Installation

    Go to the Releases section on the right.
    Download the appropriate archive for your operating system (...-windows.zip or ...-macos.dmg).

For Windows

    Extract the .zip archive to a convenient folder (e.g., C:\AI-Tools).
    Run the AI.Nexus.Toolkit.exe file.

    Note: On first launch, Windows Defender SmartScreen may show a warning. This is standard for new, unsigned applications. Click "More info" -> "Run anyway" to proceed.


📦 Supported Model Catalog

Our toolkit supports a growing arsenal of AI models for various tasks:
🎨 Image Generation

    Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111 WebUI): The classic, feature-rich interface for image generation.
    Stable Diffusion (ComfyUI): A powerful, node-based interface for creating complex pipelines and animations.
    Fooocus: A minimalist and simple interface for getting high-quality images quickly.
    Includes out-of-the-box support for SD 1.5, SDXL, Turbo, and ControlNet models.

💬 Language Models (LLMs)
